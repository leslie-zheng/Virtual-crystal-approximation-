# Virtual-crystal-approximation-
# this simple script is to give the combination of two different elements for alloy to calculate the harmonic dynamic properties in almabte
# requirements: sencond order force constants for two different elements and put into current directory
# for example: FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND_Si and  FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND_Ge to generate FORCE_CONSTANTS_VCA
# then apply phonopy to get what you want.
